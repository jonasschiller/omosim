# OMoSim: An Open Mobility Demand Simulator

Omosim (formerly known as OMOD) is a tool that creates synthetic mobility demand based on OpenStreetMap data
for a user-defined location.
The generated demand describes what an agent *plans* to do on a given day
in the form of daily activity diaries ([output example](#output)).

Technically, Omosim will run for any location on Earth.
However, we calibrated the model using data from the German national household travel survey
(https://www.mobilitaet-in-deutschland.de/publikationen2017.html).
Therefore, the model's performance outside of Germany,
especially in nations with very different conditions,
is uncertain.
Additionally, the region must be mapped reasonably well in OpenStreetMap.
Especially important is good information about the size and location of buildings, about land use zones, and the road network.
Census information is not required but helpful;
see this [code example](python_tools/format_zensus2011.py) of how to correctly format census data for Omosim.

With Version 2.2 and above you can also use [Overture Maps](https://overturemaps.org) instead of OSM for building and POI data,
which is more complete in certain parts of the world (e.g., South Korea).

## Get Started

You need Java 21 or later.

1. Download the latest release of Omosim (see *Releases* on the right)
2. Download OSM data of the region you are interested in as an osm.pbf.The file can cover a larger area than the area of interest, but too large files slow down initialization. Recommended download site: https://download.geofabrik.de/
3. Get a GeoJson of the region you want to simulate. This region must be covered by the osm.pbf file. With https://geojson.io, you can easily create a geojson of an arbitrary region. Geojsons for administrative areas can be obtained quickly with https://polygons.openstreetmap.fr/.
4. Run Omosim:

   ```
   java -jar omosim-2.3.0-all.jar Path/to/GeoJson Path/to/osm.pbf 
   ```

There are multiple optional cli arguments, such as the number of agents, the number of days, or the population definition.
See all [cli options here](#CLI-Options) or run --help.

## Visualization

A visualization tool for Omosim is available at: https://github.com/L-Strobel/omosim-visualizer

<p align="center">
   <img src="doc/images/omosim_vis_far.png" width="1000" alt="omosim Visualization Würzburg Far"/>
</p>

## Routing Mode

Omosim determines the destination choice of agents based on a gravity model.
The necessary distances from A to B can be calculated with the
routing mode GraphHopper and Beeline.
The first calculates the distance by car using the open-source router GraphHopper
(https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper).
This mode leads to the best result.
However, it also takes significantly longer to compute.
Luckily, most heavy computations can be cached.
Therefore, the first run is slow, but subsequent runs are fast.
The second mode uses the Euclidean distance
and is significantly faster but less precise.

Change the routing mode with the CLI flag *\--routing_mode* to either *GRAPHHOPPER* or *BEELINE*.

## Population Definition

It is possible to separate the population into different strata/groups and assign each individual properties (--population_file=*path\to\file*).

Example:

```
[
  {
    "stratumName": "Young Generation",  // Can be chosen freely
    "stratumShare": 0.5,                // Must add up to 1.0 with the shares of the other strata
    "carOwnership": 0.30,               // Share of car ownership in the group
    "age": {                            
      "limits": [10, 20, 30],           // Defines the age distribution of the stratum. The limits define the upper bounds of each bin. Inside each bin, the distribution is uniform. For example, here, 25% of the group is aged between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive).
      "shares": [0.25, 0.5, 0.25],      // These values combined with the value of 'UNDEFINED' must add up to 1.0
      "UNDEFINED": 0.0
    },
    "homogenousGroup": {                // Shares of the hom. Groups in the stratum. Must add up to 1.0
      "WORKING":  0.0,
      "NON_WORKING": 0.0,
      "PUPIL_STUDENT": 0.0,
      "UNDEFINED": 1.0
    },
    "mobilityGroup": {                 // Shares of the mob. Groups in the stratum. Must add up to 1.0
      "CAR_USER": 0.2,
      "CAR_MIXED": 0.2,
      "NOT_CAR": 0.6,
      "UNDEFINED": 0.0
    },
    "sex": {                           // Shares of the sexes in the stratum. Must add up to 1.0
      "MALE": 0.5,
      "FEMALE": 0.5,
      "UNDEFINED": 0.0
    }
  },
  {
     "stratumName": "Old Generation",
     "stratumShare": 0.5,
     "carOwnership": 0.60,
     "age": {
        "limits": [30, 60, 80],
        "shares": [0.25, 0.5, 0.25],
        "UNDEFINED": 0.0
     },
     "homogenousGroup": {
        "WORKING":  0.0,
        "NON_WORKING": 0.0,
        "PUPIL_STUDENT": 0.0,
        "UNDEFINED": 1.0
     },
     "mobilityGroup": {
        "CAR_USER": 0.6,
        "CAR_MIXED": 0.2,
        "NOT_CAR": 0.2,
        "UNDEFINED": 0.0
     },
     "sex": {
        "MALE": 0.5,
        "FEMALE": 0.5,
        "UNDEFINED": 0.0
     }
  },
  ...
]
```

## [EXPERIMENTAL] Calibration

It is possible to calibrate Omosim with local data. Currently, only traffic count data is supported.
The entire calibration pipeline is experimental at this point.

### Calibration Input Format

*--calibration_traffic_count_file*

Calibration data is supplied as a file,
which must be a **semicolon**-separated CSV with the following format:

| name | counts | direction | geometry |
|------|--------|-----------|----------|
| TEXT | ARRAY  | REAL      | WKT      |

Example:

| name | counts      | direction | geometry                                                      |
|------|-------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| TC1  | [100, 1000] | 270       | POLYGON ((49.8 9.9, 49.7 9.9, 49.7 9.8, 49.8 9.8, 49.8 9.99)) |
| TC2  | [10, 300]   | 90        | POLYGON ((49.8 9.9, 49.7 9.9, 49.7 9.8, 49.8 9.8, 49.8 9.99)) |
| ...  | ...         | ...       | ...                                                           |

- *name*: Name of the traffic counting station. Can be any string.
- *count*: Traffic counts. Must be a string of the form "[x, y, z]", where each element represents a traffic count.
You can supply arbitrarily many counts. However, each sensor must have the same number of counts.
The counts are assumed to be evenly spaced over a single.
For example:
  - One count for the entire day: "[2000]"
  - 4h-intervals: "[100, 400, 1000, 1000, 400, 100]". The first value addresses the time frame from 00:00 - 03:59
the second from 04:00 - 08:00 and so on.
- *direction*: Direction in which the sensor counts traffic. Unit: degrees. 0: North,  90: East,  180: South, 270: West.
- *geometry*: Field of vision of the sensor. Each sensor is assumed to count traffic passing through its field of vision
that is moving in the direction specified by the *direction* column.

### Calibration Steps

*--calibration_steps*

This option defines what calibration steps will be applied.
You can give this option multiple times to run multiple steps consecutively.
Each step is of the format: TYPE:ALG:ACTIVITY,..:PARAMS

Example:

   ```
   --calibration_steps GRAVITY:SM_PSO:OTHER,WORK:iterations=1000:lb=0.2:ub=1.2 --calibration_steps EVALUATE::::
   
   ```

This will first calibrate the gravity model for the activities *Other* and *Work*
using the PSO algorithm with the surrogate model (SM).
The last three parameters are supplied to the optimization algorithm.
Here, they set the number of iterations to 1000 and the upper and lower bounds for location attraction values
to 20% and 120% of their original value.
The second step will evaluate the calibration results and print some metrics to standard output.

Each step must always contain 3 colons. If you want to use default values for algorithms, etc.,
you can leave the space between colons empty.

Options per step:

- TYPE: GRAVITY, MODE_CHOICE, ROUTE_CHOICE, EVALUATE

Currently only for GRAVITY:

- ALG: SM_LBFGS, SM_GD, SM_PSO, PSO, PSO_AO, SM_SPSA, SPSA, SPSA_AO, SM_WSPSA, WSPSA
- ACTIVITY: HOME, WORK, SCHOOL, SHOPPING, OTHER
- PARAMS: [See algorithm implementations](src/main/kotlin/de/uniwuerzburg/omosim/calibration/algorithms) 

The only supported order of steps currently is:

Gravity → Mode Choice → Route Choice

Evaluate can be put at any point, and steps can be repeated or excluded.

### Total population

*--calibration_population*

This option specifies the total population in the simulated area (including the buffer area).
Necessary if **no** census data is provided to scale up the simulated traffic to the actual expected traffic.

### Using the calibration

A calibration run will output files to the directory specified by the *--calibration_out_dir* option.
These can be supplied to a normal run with the options:
- *--calibration_file_gravity*: for gravity model calibration
- *--calibration_file_mode_choice*: for mode choice model calibration
- *--calibration_file_route_choice*: for route choice calibration

   public static void main (String[] args) {
      File areaFile = new File("Path/to/GeoJson");
      File osmFile = new File("Path/to/osm.pbf");
   
      // Create a simulator
      Omosim omosim = Omosim.Companion.defaultFactory(areaFile, osmFile);
   
      // Run for 1000 agents, an undefined start day, and 1 day
      List<MobiAgent> agents = omosim.run(1000, Weekday.UNDEFINED, 1);
   
      // Do something with the result. E.g. get conducted activities 
      List<ActivityType> activities = new LinkedList<ActivityType>();
      for (MobiAgent agent : agents) {
         for (Diary diary : agent.getMobilityDemand()) {
            for (Activity activity : diary.getActivities()) {
                activities.add(activity.getType());
            }
         }
      }
   }

--share_pop=<float>          Share of the population to simulate. 0.0 = 0%,
                             1.0 = 100% If populate_buffer_area = y,
                             additional agents are created to populate the
                             buffer area.

                             to UNDEFINED, all simulated days will be
                             UNDEFINED.
--out=<path>                 Output file. The output format is inferred from
                             the ending: '.json' -> Json, '.xml'-> MATSim,
                             '.db'-> SQLite
--routing_mode=(GRAPHHOPPER|BEELINE)
                             Distance calculation method for destination
                             choice. Either euclidean distance (BEELINE) or
                             routed distance by car (GRAPHHOPPER)
--od=<path>                  [Experimental] Path to an OD-Matrix in GeoJSON
                             format. The matrix is used to further calibrate
                             the model to the area using k-factors.
--census=<path>              Path to population data in GeoJSON format. For
                             an example of how to create such a file see
                             python_tools/format_zensus2011.py. Should cover
                             the entire area, but can cover more.
--grid_precision=<float>     Allowed average distance between a focus area
                             building and its corresponding TAZ center. The
                             default is 150m and suitable in most cases.In
                             the buffer area the allowed distance increases
                             quadratically with distance. Unit: meters
--buffer=<float>             Distance by which the focus area (defined by
                             GeoJSON) is buffered in order to account for
                             traffic generated by the surrounding. Unit:
                             meters
--seed=<int>                 RNG seed.
--cache_dir=<path>           Cache directory
--populate_buffer_area=true|false
                             Determines if home locations of agents can be
                             in the buffer area (so outside of the focus
                             area). If set to 'y' additional agents will be
                             created so that the proportion of agents in and
                             outside the focus area is the same as in the
                             census data. The focus area will always be
                             populated by n_agents agents.
--distance_matrix_cache_size=<int>
                             Maximum number of entries of the distance
                             matrix to precompute (only if routing_mode is
                             GRAPHHOPPER). A high value will lead to high
                             RAM usage and long initialization times but

                             CPU-Cores available.
--gtfs_file=<path>           Path to an General Transit Feed Specification
                             (GTFS) for the area. Required for public
                             transit routing,for example if public transit
                             is an option in mode choice. Must be a .zip
                             file or a directory (see https://gtfs.org/).

                             RELEASE. Where RELEASE is a valid overture
                             release. For an introduction to Overture Maps
                             see https://overturemaps.org/
--matsim_output_crs=<text>   CRS of MatSIM output. Must be a code understood
